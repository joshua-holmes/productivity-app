# Productivity App

Productivity App is a simple dashboard and suite of tools that provides an overview of a user's personal finances, created for Flatiron School's phase 2 project.

## Description

On the dashboard, you can find your favorite stocks and an overview of your budget over any selected month/months. You can navigate to the app's various pages using the sidebar. These pages contain useful tools such as a retirement calculator, a budget, a pros and cons list, and a view of recent stock updates and prices.
